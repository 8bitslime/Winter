# Winter
Winter is intended to be a high speed, low memory usage scripting language with a focus
on being easily embedded. It is heavily inspired by Lua, but will have changes in areas
where I feel need improvement (most notably: arrays starting at 1). It will provide an
easy to use C API for use in almost any language that supports it. It is still a work in
progress and is currently unusable. Pull requests are open though.
